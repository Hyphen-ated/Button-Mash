Button Mash is an Input Display written mainly to display SNES controller input.

It currently support SNES Classic hacked with Hakchi2 CE, Arduino based solution for real hardware (using Nintendo Spy firmware), Usb2Snes and regular controllers.

Note: the USB handling of the FxPax/Sd2Snes has up to five frames of jitter at all times. If you're using one of those flash carts and you want an input display that is more accurate than that, you'll need a hardware device like a RetroSpy.
